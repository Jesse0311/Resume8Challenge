                    </h3>
                    <p>During the month of December 2021(1st - 14th of Dec), I earned an 'Intro To Web' Certificate
                        after an
                        informative 2 week BootCamp with CodeSpace. In this course I learned to code in both HTML and
                        CSS
                        using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> and was
                        able
                        to use this platform to create our my Digital Resume. I've been introduced to lots of
                        opportunities
                        in the Coding field during this short space, which is a great foundation.</p>

                    <h3>I learned 2D Animation at <a href="https://www.aie.ac/" target="_blank">AIE</a>. Jan - Dec 2019
                    </h3>
                    <p>During the year 2019, I earned an 'Advanced 2D Animation and Illustration' certificate after an
                        exciting 1 year course with Academic Institute of Excellence. In this course I was exposed to 2D
                        Illustration concepts and animation techniques with the help of Adobe Photoshop and
                        Illustration,
                        Toon Boom's Storyboard Pro and Toon Boom's Harmony. At the end of my 1 year course I was able to
                        create my own 2D animation using the various animation and editing platforms.</p>
